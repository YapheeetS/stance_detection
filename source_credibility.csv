The ADF opposes abortion, and believes that healthcare workers have a right to decline participation in the performance of abortions and other practices an individual health worker finds morally objectionable. ADF opposes same-sex marriage and civil unions, as well as adoption by same-sex couples based on their belief that children are best raised by a married mother and father. ADF believes parents should be able to opt their children out of sex education in schools that run counter to a family’s religious beliefs.

While opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage, APP largely focuses on promoting immigration reform, opposing the Common Core curriculum, and defending religious liberty (against LGBTQ and abortion). They have also advocated for monetary reform by suggesting a return to the gold standard. In reviewing the website the primary mission according to their articles is to suppress women’s rights through banning abortion and limiting the freedom and liberty of LGBTQ. They also use misleading information such as the debunked video of Planned Parenthood selling baby parts.

Questionable	Extreme Bias	Notes: A Voice for Men (AVFM) is a men’s human right advocacy site run by Paul Elam, the titular leader of the men’s rights movement in America. AVFM is not so much a news source as an extended blog and echo chamber consisting primarily of op-ed style content decrying the feminist movement and touting what Mr. Elam and other contributors see as the persecution of males in a female run society. There is very little external sourcing for any of the content, and what source links I did follow led only to other anti-feminism opinion pieces and sites. The content is heavily weighted against feminism, and much of it revolves around the usual men’s rights issues. Divorce, custody, child support, men’s reproductive rights, etc. The site earns a Questionable rating based on the extreme bias of its men’s rights advocacy. (D. Kelley 3/4/2017)	avoiceformen.com

Questionable	Clickbait, Some Fake News	Notes: Breaking911 does not have an about page, therefore who runs the site and their mission is unknown. Breaking911 appears to republish breaking news headlines and crime stories from around the world. For example, they republsh news from NBC: Trump Bodyguard: Trump Was Offered 5 Russian Women, Turned Offer Down or CNN “Secret Service Agent Working Trump Motorcade Run Down By Vehicle, Driver Arrested” and at the same time they capitalize on clickbait-type headlines such as “NSFW: Leaked video of Cardi B exposing her bare boobs surfaces and crime stories from local media “Husband Kills Wife Less Than 15 Minutes Into New Year, Police Say.” Further, Breaking911 does not appear to have a political bias, but rather publishes sensationalized stories regardless of political affiliation. In reviewing factual reporting for Breaking911, we found a false claim via Politifact. In this breaking news story they published that an ISIS member tweeted about the Chattanooga mass shooting 15 minutes before it happened. The source of this was the highly questionable Pam Geller, who has a poor track record with fact checkers. Other poor media outlets also reported this, but within a few hours this was refuted as being false. Breaking911 did not delete or amend their story to indicate it was actually false. Overall, we rate Breaking911 a Questionable Source based on promotion of clickbait headlines, that do not fully match the stories and the publication of false information. (M.

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Hate Group	Notes: Concerned Women for America (CWA) is a socially conservative Christian non-profit women’s activist group in the United States. Headquartered in Washington D.C., the CWA is heavily involved in many social and political movements, through which it aims to support and incorporate Christian ideology. The CWA identifies itself as an amalgam of “policy experts and activists” whose anti-feminist approach to politics bolsters its mission to “protect and promote Biblical values among all citizens.” Essentially, Concerned Women for America is an anti-feminist group that is 100% opposed to abortion and is vehemently opposed to equal rights for LGBTQ. In fact, the Southern Poverty Law Center has them classified as an anti-gay hate group. CWA also publishes a blog on its website that is pro-right wing and against anything related to the left or feminism. In short, this is an extreme right christian biased group that advocates for discrimination of LGBTQ and hence is a very questionable source. (D. Van Zandt 8/18/2017).

Sources listed in the Questionable Categorymaybe very untrustworthy and should be fact checked on a per article basis. Please note sources on this listare notconsideredfake newsunless specifically written in the notes section for that source.See all Questionable sources.	Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda	Notes: Conservative Firing Line is a news and opinion website with an extreme right wing bias. We will break this source down using our criteria. First, we look at wording and headlines. With these, Conservative Firing Line heavily uses emotional loaded words that are pro-right and anti-left. An example of a highly biased headline is as follows: Kid Rock triggers liberal snowflakes with true statement about life and hard work… The use of the words “triggers liberal snowflakes” is about as extreme as you can get using loaded words to emotionally sway readers. Next, we look at sourcing and factual reporting. In this area Conservative Firing Line makes an effort to source their information. However, there are many cases when they source to far right media sources or other questionable sources such as Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children, which has a poor track record with fact checkers. We could not find any evidence of Conservative Firing Line failing a fact check, but we did find them promoting unproven conspiracies such as the Clinton’s murdering multiple people. Within this article about the Clinton’s they source numerous questionable and conspiracy websites. For factual reporting, Conservative Firing Line is mixed due to misleading headlines and the use of poor sources. Our next criteria is balanced reporting. Does Conservative Firing Cover both sides of issues in their articles? The answer to that is a 100% no. They never do. This source is 100% biased for conservatives and against liberals. Lastly, we look at the website’s political affiliation and how they describe themselves. According to their about page “The Conservative Firing Line was established in May 2012 in an effort to inform, educate and inspire grassroots conservatives at all levels.” Therefore, we rate them right biased for political affiliation. Conclusion: Conservative Firing Line is questionable due to extreme right wing bias, sometimes utilizing poor sources and the promotion of right wing propaganda/conspiracies. (D.

Questionable	Extreme Right, Fake News	Notes: According to their about page Daily World Information describe its focus as “Here you can find politic news, news about celebrities, politicians and everything that is happening in the world.“ However, who runs the site is not known. Daily World Information publishes stories with sensational loaded words such as “BOMBSHELL: Michelle Obama Was Caught Dating Someone Secretly!” In this article they place a picture of Michelle Obama and Prince Henry hugging without elaborating further. Without a disclaimer stating the website is satire, we assume this is just a fake news story, since it obviously is not true. Daily World Information also publishes other fake stories such as “Breaking News: Obama’s Half Sister Maya Was Working As a Prostitute Back In The 90’s?” They also pass fake Breaking news such as “BREAKING: New York Times Connected With ANTIFA – What Just LEAKED Is Shocking.” The general theme is all fake news stories are those that would appeal to the extreme right.

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Some Fake News	Notes: Danger and Play is the blog/website for Mike Cernovich, an American social media personality and author. He is usually described as part of the alt-right, however he describes himself as “new right.” Cernovich is known for promoting false or unproven stories such as the claim that Hilary Clinton has Parkinson’s Disease and most recently the debunked Pizzagate scandal. Clinton having Parkinson’s has been debunked here and here. Pizzagate has been debunked here and here. Danger and Play also has an extreme right bias in it’s promotion of conservatives and vilification of liberals as seen in both the Parkinson’s and Pizzagate conspiracies. Further, Mr. Cernovich has also landed a Pants on Fire rating from Politifact for his claim that Cleveland police are not ‘standing down’ during RNC. Overall, this source has an extreme right wing bias in reporting, promotes propaganda/conspiracy and should be viewed as highly questionable for accurate information. (3/27/2017)	dangerandplay.com

Questionable	Right Bias, Pro-Israel	Notes: Founded by Giora Shamis and Diane Shalem, DEBKAfile is an Israeli military intelligence website based in Jerusalem. They are primarily focused on the Middle East and they provide commentary and analyses on terrorism, intelligence, military and international relations. In their own words: “DEBKAFile was founded by a team of journalists in June 2000 […], DEBKAfile is an independent Internet Web site, providing an intelligence and security news service.” In review, DEBKAfile does not provide sources for their claims, instead using “Our sources” in their commentaries. There is very little use of loaded language, however other sources have reported that DEBKAfile holds a neoconservative and pro-Israel position. While the claims made on DEBKAfile may very well be true, without knowing the sources of their information we cannot verify them. Therefore, we rate DEBKAfile Questionable based on lack of sourcing.

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Hate Group	Notes: Founded in 2016, Defend Europa is an Alt-Right White Nationalist organization. According to their about page the Defend Europa website, covers issues like “‘migrant crisis’, the European Union, globalization, and commentary in support of nationalist movements across the continent.” While the owner of website is not mentioned, the about page was published on February 27, 2016 by “Jason Bergkamp“, who’s bio on the site says “Jason Bergkamp is a Dutch based journalist.” According to a Washington Post article Jason Bergkamp is a known supporter of Hitler “In April, Trump retweeted a compliment from an innocuous-looking follower named Jason Bergkamp; a reporter from Fusion quickly discovered that Bergkamp had also praised Hitler.” In review, Defend Europa uses loaded emotional language and in their articles and headlines: “The Never Ending Rise of Anti-White Politics in the UK” They frequently use factually mixed sources such as the Daily Mail, The Sun, and Daily Mirror, however they also occasionally use high factual sources such as The Guardian, but they always take the information out of context and spin it to the white nationalists favor. Defend Europa also recently interviewed alt-right white nationalist Richard Spencer. Overall, we rate Defend Europa as a Questionable source due to poor sourcing, hate language and affiliation with known white nationalists. (M. Huitsing 10/8/2017).

Democratic Moms has a pants on fire claim from Politifact and is also listed on their fake news list. This source is a combination of propaganda, extreme bias and fake news. (6/12/2017) Notes 2: The site is called Democratic Moms, but the about us page names the site TheViralDance and describes itself as “From your daily dose of celebrities, via style and relationships, to posts that will inspire you – our team will bring you everything you wanted to know, and some stuff you didn’t even know you needed!“ Democratic Moms uses emotional language that favors liberals and discredits conservatives. They typically only report one side of the story, for example: “Barack Obama’s 21 Greatest Moments as AMERICA president” and breaking-56-generals-and-admirals-join-forces-to-nip-trumps-evil-plan-in-the-bud. When sourcing they typically use far left or questionable sources. The fact that this site does not have a contact page and the about page does not match with what they write, we rate Democratic Moms as a questionable site with an extreme left bias.

En-Volve has also published ridiculous stories such as “Obama Orders Life-Sized Bronze Statue of Himself to Be Permanently Installed in White House?” and this “Colin Kaepernick FIRED From 49ers After Disrespecting Police and National Anthem,” which obviously is not true as he played the entire season with them after this fake news article was published. Since, En-Volve does not have an about page stating they are satire, we must assume they are just a propaganda site that publishes fake news. According to Politifact they are a fake news source.

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy	Notes (D. Van Zandt): Freedom Outpost is an extreme right wing news website. The website publishes articles with sensational headlines that uses strong emotional loaded words to either favor conservatives or denigrate liberals. Freedom Outpost also uses questionable language when talking about African Americans. Further, Freedom Outpost has received a pants on fire claim by Politifact. This source also Promotes conspiracies such as Hillary Clinton being linked to Seth Rich’s murder and the Obama’s deep state. In both of these articles almost all sourcing is coming from other articles on the Freedom Outpost website and not from outside credible sources. Based on poor sourcing and a known failed fact check they are rated as an extreme right, questionable source. Notes: (M. Allen): With tea party sponsored posts like this: http://freedomoutpost.com/lets-study-the-constitution-part-v-bill-of-rights/And hit pieces about the possible son of Bill Clinton, which has been something floating around since the 90’s, the site freedomoutpost.com caters to a right leaning crowd with hit pieces and flashy titles. Going back to this title: Let’s Study The Constitution, Part V – Bill of Rights lets focus on the lack of any citation for something that is supposedly trying to educate people about the constitution.  The Bill of Rights are an extremely complicated aspect of the constitution.  But they make several key failures in explaining it and for good reason.  Here’s one: “So, the purpose of the Bill of Rights was to limit the Federal government, not the People.”[i] – this is basically what they are trying to get across in this whole thing. But even when drafting these bill of rights, it was only done to get buy in from other members of congress at the time. Madison and Hamliton, both federalist, believed that the creation of the bill of rights would have the exact opposite effect.  In Federalist #84 Hamilton says: “…it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretense for claiming that power. They might urge with a semblance of reason that the Constitution ought not to be charged with the absurdity of providing against the abuse of an authority which was not given, and that the provision against restraining the liberty of the press afforded a clear implication that a power prescribe proper regulations concerning it was intended to be vested in the national government.”[ii]. His argument bares fruit when viewed at the bill of rights today. With the creation of the FCC to regulate “media,” Patriot Act & many different laws around the 2nd amendment from a federal and state level.    Their simplistic view of the Bill of Rights removes many of the pro and cons one might get from reading the framing of the constitution to begin with. The Federalist Papers and by that notion the Anti Federalist Papers[iii], which I would urge anyone reading about US politics familiarize yourself with. Some examples of titles that are ridiculous: UNPLUGGING SAURON: EVEN SOME IN WASHINGTON ARE BEGINNING TO SEE THE TROUBLE WITH MOUNT DOOM. Pelosi Questions President Trump’s Fitness, then Lapses into Insanity – to be fair Pelosi does call President Trump, Bush several times but that does not make her Insane. Forgetful, perhaps. The site uses known right wing media sources and often just reposts articles from them such as the extreme right biased – http://constitution.com. They do use source video’s from CNN and CSPAN as well.

There is little to no sourcing in the stories, and with no bylines I assume all of them are written by Ms Giles herself. In total, GJWHG resembles a personal blog more than an actual news source. Much of the content also borders on conspiracy, only saved by the fact that most of the stories do have at least some basis in fact. Still, the obvious bias, lack of credible sourcing, and conspiracy overtones earn GJWHG a questionable rating. (D. Kelley 6/12/2017)	girlsjustwannahaveguns.com

However, the Globe publishes even more outrageous stories than the Enquirer and many of them a just plain fake and almost always unproven. The Globe is not a credible media source and should be consumed for entertainment purposes only.	globemagazine.com

The GOP Watchdog does have an about page, but does not indicate a name of the owner or authors. The content of headlines and articles uses extensive loaded words and most times quote sources that are left biased or questionable such as Alternet and Occupy Democrats.  Despite occasionally using proper sources, each article amounts to an opinion piece from an anonymous author. This destroy any credibility and render this website as left wing propaganda. Due to misleading wording, an anonymous author, extreme left bias and poor sourcing we rate the GOP Watchdog a questionable source. (M. Huitsing 7/28/2017)	thegopwatchdog.com

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Hate Group, Some Fake News	Notes: GotNews is an Alt-Right news and opinion website with extreme right wing bias in reporting. GotNews is founded and owned by Charles C. Johnson who has been called an internet troll and the most hated man on the internet. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center Johnson has numerous ties to the racist “Alt-Right” and has professed white supremacist views. He also has made controversial quotes such as these: (On Blacks) “that they’re systematically discriminating against blacks for some reason. Or you have to believe the more obvious thing which is that they’re dumber. And enough experience with them kind of persuades you that the dumber thing is probably true.” (On Jews) “And it is interesting how the things that are the most screwed up in our society — media, education, and government — seem to have a disproportionate number of them.” GotNews also routinely publishes unproven claims such as this. In short, we rate GotNews as questionable based on unproven claims, blatant white supremacy and promotion of right wing propaganda. To learn more about Charles C. Johnson and GotNews we recommend Wikipedia. (D. Van Zandt 8/12/2017)	gotnews.com

The owner of the site is unknown, editor of the site is also unknown. They have a contact page only.  Hawar News Agency rarely sources their news pieces at all and in some cases they use questionable sources. According to Pro-Syrian opposition source Verify-sy  Hawar News is affiliated with the Democratic Union Party (PYD) and by affiliation they have a strong left wing bias. Further, they indicate rumors as their source under the analysis headline such as this: “There are changes in Aleppo, Idleb and Hama”. Hawar News Agency uses strong loaded language in both sensational headlines and also the body of articles, therefore we rate Hawar News Agency as mixed for factual reporting and a questionable propaganda website with extreme left bias.

The primary theme of this blog appears to be the promotion of white male rights. In review, I, hypocrite uses loaded words frequently in headlines and articles. For example, on their about page they refer to feminism as a “Narcissistic Mental Disorder.” All articles favor the right and use terms such as “snowflake” to describe those with liberal view points. In another article they use the racist symbol Pepe the Frog for no apparent reason other than to declare their position on race and gender equality.

InfoGalactic’s newsfeed does not contain original content, but rather curated news stories. On their news page they also link to a host of websites and writers so that readers may view their news. Some notable names on the list that fall within our Questionable or Conspiracy categories are: Mike Cernovich, Milo Yiannopoulos, Taki’s Magazine, Return of Kings, Zerohedge and Roosh V.

In reviewing their Wikipages, they are very similar in content to Wikipedia when it comes to political figures. InfoGalactic sources all information and typically uses credible sources.

Outside of an address in Ireland the website does not disclaim their ownership or names affiliated with this group. In review, Just the Facts promotes that human life begins at conception. Obviously, if cells are dividing it is alive and no one would dispute that. The website emphasizes repeatedly this fact and is detailed in describing Foetal pain. Essentially, this is an anti-abortion website that never mentions abortion. While most of the science on the website is accurate and linked to credible medical journals and text books, there is also use of sources that are highly discredited such as the The American College of Pediatricians, which has been labeled a hate group due to anti-LGBTQ positions.

There is just enough facts for the author to make outrageous assertions that are highly misleading. In one such article, Liberty Brief is very upset that the Obama’s have signed a deal with a speaking agency. In her words: “the Obamas have now figured out a brand new way to con our country and rake in millions while sitting on their lazy asses.” One has to wonder what the author is implying when referring to the Obama’s as lazy? In short, Liberty Brief is a virtual credible website. In reality it is questionable.(3/23/2017)	libertybrief.com

This is the definition of an unfair bias and one of the main reasons why everyday American’s confidence in the “Main Stream” media is at an all time low.” In review, the MagaPill website consists of links to archived news stories that highlight Donald Trump’s accomplishments as President. For the most part they link to mainstream news sources, however they also often to link to the Alt-Right website Breitbart, which has a poor track record with fact checkers. MagaPill has also been highlighted as a fake news, conspiracy website by the highly credible conservative Weekly Standard.

A quick trip to their Facebook page, https://www.facebook.com/us.native.americans/ provides you that they are categorizing themselves as a “Magazine.” Their about us is interesting as well: “We Native Americans are NGO and do not hold backgrounds and don`t support companies nor institutions in politics, medicine, weapons, drugs, any other illegal activity or science and anything read on this website should be read with an open mind and taken with a grain of salt.

(just an FYI to those who don’t know how they could have 200k followers, they buy them). First, let us look at this about us on their Facebook page. I hardly expect a Native American organization to have such improper grammar. The second paragraph is also extremely questionable in that I have no idea what they are saying to us in regard to the whole first part.  Request for advice?	indigenous.club

The stories on Native American News are sensational and ridiculous. Since this source does not disclose whether it is satire or not, we must assume it is serious. Many stories are simply fake news, such as NASA reporting that the earth will be in darkness for 15 days in November 2017. Most other stories are either rooted in conspiracy, pseudoscience or is just plain fake. Overall, we rate Native American News Questionable due to publishing fake news stories. (D.

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Fake News	Notes: Welcome to our new reality.  It’s not going to change anytime soon it seems. It started, who knows when at this point and it seems to only grow.  Also, who knows if its just Russian Trolls that are doing it now or if there are other countries and even inside actors doing it,  but you can certainly trace many of these types of articles and “news” to sites that track known Russian “troll” accounts in twitter, Facebook and Russian News sites like RT. News and Stories from USA is a site that was registered in Panama (the country) on Oct 25, 2017.  Its articles are mostly, if not all, made up rehashed pieces that keep resurfacing.  The most recent one I saw is: “Wikileaks Massive Exposure: Here Are 6 Republicans Who Took Bribes From Clinton To ‘Destroy Trump.”  This must be new news, right?Well it’s not.  Back in January 2017, ABCNews and others had to debunk this same exact story. http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-bribes-hillary-clinton-sabotage-donald-trump/story?id=45064731 The website then was USA News Today, which is still a website, though they don’t seem to be reporting much “NEWS” as it were. I do not suggest going to the website, but here it is. http://www.usanewstoday.com/ So we went from usanewstoday and now newsandstoriesfromusa. They’re consistent, if nothing else, in their naming practices. We are all subject to confirmation bias and sloppy critical thinking.  First, we all need to actually read articles.  The headlines are not the article and in these times, they’re mostly click bait.  Second, we all need to understand that there are people out there that are only looking to create more tension and misinformation than ever before.  It is imperative that we all take a step back from the 24/7 news cycle and look objectively at what is being presented and question the content presented with open minds. (M.

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Some Fake News	Notes: NewsWars is a news and opinion website by Infowars publisher and far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, where he claims to be bringing “truth back to the media.” He’s infamously made false claims concerning the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, and federal investigators said he inspired a gunman to open fire inside a Washington, D.C., pizzeria last year by touting unfounded allegations on his shows and websites about its supposed ties to former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and human trafficking. In review, the website is laid out to look similar to the New York Times, which both Alex Jones and Donald Trump claim is a fake news source. All news articles are curated from other sources including Jones’ own Infowars. Some common sources used are Russian propaganda news site RT, Alt-right Breitbart and other conspiracy websites such as Zero Hedge. The reason why this site is not placed in our Conspiracy-Pseudoscience category is due to having more political news than conspiracy information. Though there is plenty of conspiracy as Jones shares numerous stories from Infowars and provides a link to listen to his radio show live on the website. This website is also different in that the majority of news is real. The reason for the Questionable classification is that all stories favor the right, indicating extreme bias, there are unproven conspiracies published and Jones’ longtime reputation as a purveyor of fake news stories.

The group describes itself as a non-partisan association of current and former military, police, and first responders, who pledge to fulfill the oath that all military and police take in order to “defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” Several groups that monitor domestic terrorism and hate groups describe the Oath Keepers as extremist or radical. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) describes the group as “heavily armed extremists with a conspiratorial and anti-government mindset looking for potential showdowns with the government.” The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) lists the group’s founder as a known extremist and describes his announced plans to create localized militia units as “frightening”. According to the SPLC, the group espouses a number of conspiracy and legal theories associated with the sovereign citizen movement and the white supremacist posse comitatus movement. SPLC senior fellow Mark Potok describes the group as a whole as “really just an anti-government group who believe in a wild set of conspiracy theories.” Overall, we rate Oath Keepers a questionable source based on extreme right bias, promotion of conspiracy theories and others labeling them a hate group.

Questionable	Extreme Right, Islamophobia, Propaganda, Hate Group	Notes: Our Eye On Islam (OEOI) is an extreme right wing anti Islamic site packaging conspiracies and wildly distorted facts as “news”. There are no source links for their stories, and no byline credit for the authors except OEOI itself. There is no pretense of impartiality on OEOI, and their stories are really just a collection of the rehashed, heavily biased rhetoric, intentionally misleading and  misinterpreted “facts”, and outright fake news you typically find touted as “truth” on this type of site. As example, in their story “Norway: Deported “Record Number” of Islamics And Crime Dropped Dramatically!” they reiterate a popular falsehood about Norway targeting Muslims with its immigration policies. As reported in Truth or Fiction, Norway did reform its immigration policies in 2011. The reforms, however were in response to a record number of immigrants entering the Norway between 1995 and 2011. In fact, the majority of the immigrants, and the deportees, were not from predominantly Islamic countries. The reforms actually addressed concerns regarding the integration of such a large number immigrants, as well as prison overcrowding, but it was not specifically directed at Muslims: “One of the main objectives of Norway’s immigration reforms has been to deport foreign citizens who are serving prison time there. The country has a limited number of prisons, and 30% of its prisoners were foreign citizens at one time. Most were from Poland, Lithuania, Nigeria, Iraq and Romania, the U.S. Library of Congress reports. The country has also cracked down on the number of new immigrants allowed into the country by denying more requests for asylum. Neither of those initiatives specifically targets Muslims, however. And it’s true that 824 unwanted individuals were deported from Norway in October of 2014, but it’s not true that all of them had ties to Muslim extremist groups, as the eRumor claims. In truth, less than one-third of Norway’s immigrants have come from predominately Muslim countries (Truth or Fiction).” (D. Kelley 3/3/2017)	oureyeonislam.com

The purpose of the Patribotics blog, according to theirabout pageis to provide &#8220;investigative journalism and analysis of the Russian hack on America’s election and related topics. Pro-America, pro-democracy, pro-NATO, pro-Russia, anti-Putin.&#8221; While Patribotics does produce factual content, they also promote numerousunproven conspiracies.

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Fake News	Puppet String News is a blog with an extreme right wing bias in reporting. The ownership of the blog is not known. The site describes itself on their about page as “Puppet String News was created by a US NAVY vet, who served four years in the military, got out because he was tired of the world and its current state. Decided to get into alternative news to tell the truth to best of ability.”In review, Puppet String News publishes stories with sensational headlines such as: ”President Trump finally grabbed a pussy yesterday” and they use loaded words both in their headlines and the articles. Further, the articles are poorly sourced. Puppet String News also publishes conspiracy theories such as “Seth Rich murder connection, John Podesta ex sister-in-law is on DC Police board” On 10/2/2017 there was a mass shooting in Las Vegas that has been called the worst in USA history. Over the course of a few hours Puppet String News reported without verification thatAntifa was behind the shooting,then ISISand finally they concluded that it was an act ofmind controlthrough MK Ultra and the Deep State. Overall, Puppet String News could be rated as a conspiracy website, but due to extreme right wing bias we simply rate them a questionable source due to promotion of unverified claims and strong right wing propaganda.

https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/red-ice-tv/	Red Ice TV	NIL		Questionable	 Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Hate Group	Notes: Red Ice TV’s tagline “The future is the past” is a news platform that consists of a website, TV and online radio, including Red Ice Radio and Radio 3Fourteen run by Henrik Palmgren, who is a Swedish alt-right political vlogger. His program frequently hosts a wide variety of content, including white nationalism, antisemitic theories, the paranormal, and philosophy, frequently from a far-right perspective. Guests on the show include white nationalists such as Richard B. Spencer and Andrew Anglin (owner and founder of the Daily Stormer). The website content also contains strong anti-Muslim propaganda that showcases crimes committed by Muslims, while failing to report crimes by whites. The Southern Poverty Law Center calls Red Ice TV “a racist online radio broadcast.” Red Ice TV also interviews people who are conspiracy theorists such as L.A. Marzulli who has a false claim according to Snopes. In summary we rate this a Questionable source based on an extreme alt-right bias that promotes white nationalist propaganda, conspiracy theories and is considered a hate group by the SPLC. (M.

They state their mission as: “The idea behind RED STATE JOURNALIST is to be a centralized portal that brings the news on the US President decisions on a daily basis.” Their contact page appears to be a broken link at this time. They publish news stories under the following categories: Uncategorized, USA POLITICS, NEWS, and CRIME. Red State Journalist also has a FAQ section that mentions questions that are unrelated to a news website: What’s your return policy? Return any of our products–no questions asked–within 30 days of purchase. We even pay return shipping. (They don’t sell products). Do you have customer service? Of course! Our friendly and knowledgeable customer services reps are available to answer your questions 24/7/365. (They don’t have that either). Red State Journalist reports with extreme right wing bias as they use heavily loaded headlines such as: “​JAIL TIME: Comey Got Awful News After He Lied To Congress! It Really Is Happening!” Further, they source poorly to sources such as Zero Hedge, which promotes conspiracies, or they do not provide links at all. For example : “THIS IS SICK: Susan Rice Just Admitted What She Did To Trump’s Campaign During The Election!” Overall, we rate Red State Journalist as a Questionable Source, based on extreme right wing bias, promotion of propaganda, poor sourcing and an entirely fake FAQ section on their website.

The website has always encouraged independent views, and never encouraged any party’s agenda.” In review, Shared News Report is an extreme right wing biased website through story selection and wording. The sources used by Shared News Report are either from other extreme sources such as 0404 News: “Now The Arabs Of East Jerusalem Are Throwing Puppies At The IDF…Instead Of Rocks” or they use Infowars-Alex Jones, which is a factually low conspiracy site to back up their claims. For example: “COMPUTER AI ALGORITHM SHOWS TRUMP AT 65% APPROVAL RATING!” and “Muslims Demand The Queen Convert Or Leave England. Further, the majority of stories on the website are highly critical of Muslims through the publication of propaganda and conspiracy theories.

Questionable	Right, Propaganda, White Nationalism	Notes: South Africa Today (SAT) News is an English news and information distributor. The main aim of South Africa Today is exposure of South African news. South Africa Today also covers regional African news. South Africa Today does not have about page, therefore the editor is unknown at this time. In review, South Africa Today News use loaded words in their headlines and articles that favor the BNP (far-right and fascist political party in the United Kingdom) politician Jack Sen who is known for anti-Semitic slurs. South Africa Today also promotes the Front National Party of South Africa, which is a far right, white nationalist, secessionist party. South Africa Today republishes articles from credible sources such as The Conversation, but under the world news category they also republish factually mixed sources like Sputnik. They also publish articles without any sourcing at all. Further, many articles on the website seem to be very pro-Russian with a fascination for Vladimir Putin. Overall, we rate South Africa Today Questionable due to the publication of White Nationalist propaganda and the use of factually mixed sources. (M. Huitsing 10/9/2017)	southafricatoday.net

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda	Notes: SpeakGov.com describes itself as a blog dedicated to give every political view a platform. The site has a forum section also, but has only 1 post. The site’s blog section seems to have only bloggers with strong right wing bias that use loaded language without any sources at all such as The Leftist Media Coup et Detat. In other cases the bloggers are sourcing far right sources or outright questionable sources such as the Gateway Pundit, which has a horrible record with fact checkers. Although there are a few bloggers posting information from the left, the majority is far right.

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Anti-Islam	Notes: Speisa is a website that publishes sensational stories. The owner/editor of the website is unknown. According to their about page Speisa describes its content as “posts are not satire, as lots of real, really strange stuff are happening in this strange world. Some news are funny, some are sad, and some are plain horrific.” Speisa publishes anti-Muslim articles such as “Geldof to house four Syrian families.” They report this news story factually at first, and then interject anti-Muslim commentary such as these quotes: “Then it will be Geldof wearing an orange jump suit, ready to be beheaded on video and broadcasted via Raqqa. Ignorant Geldof will finally be able to see how Islam plays out.” This generalization of Syrian refugees indicates extreme bias against Muslims. Speisa also publishes sensational click bait headlines that focuses on a variety of topics mostly with emotionally loaded headlines and content such as “Obamagate: Photo shows Obama’s ties to radical Islam.” Speisa frequently uses factually mixed sources such as The Daily Caller and Daily Mail. Overall, this site is a questionable source due to publication of anti-Muslim propaganda and poor sourcing with an extreme right wing bias. (M. Huitsing 1/29/2018)	speisa.com

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy	Notes: Squawker is a news and opinion website that claims to be a fact checker, especially of the mainstream media. In reality this is a website that promotes conspiracies with an extreme right bias. We have decided to classify this website as questionable versus a conspiracy-pseudoscience site due to the extreme political bias that always favors the right and discredits the left. An example of a conspiracy article is one entitled: Is Obama Plotting A Second Civil War? EX-Aide Says Yes, Obama Still Thinks He’s The President. There isn’t evidence that Obama is plotting anything or thinks he is still President. The primary source for this story is Dick Morris and Infowars. A conspiracy takes a story such as Obama holding meetings each day and opines a much more sinister plot. This is a classic example of conspiracy and also propaganda. In order to keep this short I will just summarize that this website is very anti-Islam and openly declares them an enemy. They also have a ridiculous article using skewed stats that show men are raped by women at an equal rate as women. Overall, this is an extreme right wing biased website that promotes propaganda and conspiracy. (8/10/2017)	squawker.org

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda	Notes: Stares at the World  is an Alt-Right blog founded by Davis M.J. Aurini. According his about page he studied history at McMaster University, he served as an Infantry soldier in the Canadian Forces and with his own words he is “a Scholar, Author, Film Maker, and a God fearing Catholic, who loves women for their illogical nature.” He also has bio with IMDB. Aurini, according to Rationalwiki is a “race realist” (which he insists isn’t “racism”), white nationalist, neoreactionary, vlogger, and novelist.” They describe his Vlogs as “His vlog posts typically deal in misogyny, evolutionary psychology, and complaints about white knights, along with some healthy fascist fanfare and racism for good measure.” Stares at the World blog covers such topics as Politics, Science Fiction, Theology, And Women. Davis M.J. Aurini also publishes misogynist videos about women such as: “The Most Decadent Sluts Since the Fall of Rome.” According to a The Daily Dot article, Davis M.J. Aurini also contributes for blogger and men’s rights activist Roosh. Davis M.J. Aurini also produces videos for a fee under Aurinis-Insight. In review, Stares at the World publishes stories (vlogs) with loaded emotional headlines that lean strongly right such as: “A Donald Trump Victory is Vital for Our Future.” Further, most articles/vlogs are typically sourced through quotes, rather than linking. Overall, we rate Stares at the World as a questionable source due to extreme right wing bias, poor sourcing and questionable content regarding race and gender. (M.

State Fort Daily also reports fake conspiracy stories such as the Hillary Clinton Uranium deal, which has been debunked for almost 2 years.

Please note sources on this listare notconsideredfake newsunless specifically written in the notes section for that source.See all Questionable sources.	Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy	Notes: Stone Cold Truth (SCT) is not a news site so much as a personal blog for Roger Stone. Mr. Stone is a conservative libertarian writer and political pundit, who bills himself as a “Legendary American Political Operative.” The stories on SCT are poorly sourced, marginally factual, and much of the writing borders on conspiracy. Additionally, many of the reference sources at the end of the stories, such as The Daily Caller, are listed as Right Biased or Questionable themselves. As with many extremely biased sites on both the left and the right, many of the facts presented in the stories are either taken out of context or misrepresented. Example: In the story titled “The Numbers Don’t Lie: Proof Of Fake News Confirmed” the author, Saint John Hunt, conflates a Harvard study showing the percentage of negative press regarding President Trump during his first hundred days with inaccurate reporting. The study does show a high percentage of negative press, and also shows a distinct negative bias from the press towards Trump during that time on some networks, including CNN and CBS. The study does not, however, gauge the accuracy of the reporting on the networks. Negativity does not automatically equate to falsehood, and the use of the numbers from the study as the centerpiece of the story is, at best, misleading. Due to the overt bias, poor sourcing, and misleading and misrepresented facts, STC is rated Questionable. (D. Kelley 7/10/2017)	stonecoldtruth.com

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda	Notes: Subject Politics is an extreme right wing news and opinion website as evidenced by their mission statement on their About page: “It is our mission to disrupt the liberal echo-chamber of victimization, moral relativism, and political correctness that suppresses honest conversation and debate.” Subject Politics uses extreme loaded language in headlines such as this: “IT’S OVER! Trump Just Went On Twitter & EXPOSED Obama’s Sick Plan! **MAKE THIS GO VIRAL.” The words “Sick Plan” is a highly negative connotation that attempts to blame former President Obama for a judges decision, where there isn’t evidence to support it. Further, in this same article they copy and paste this quote as evidence of Obama’s “sick plan”: “JUDGE WILLIAM H. ORRICK, THE FEDERAL JUDGE IN SAN FRANSISCO (spelling error), WHO BLOCKED TRUMP’S ORDER THAT WOULD DEFUND SANCTUARY CITIES, IS AN OBAMA DONOR WHO GAVE $200,000 TO GET HIM ELECTED!” There isn’t a source for this quote, so we don’t know who said it or made that claim, in fact there isn’t any source at all for this news article other than some tweets from President Trump. Furthermore, Judge Orrick did not donate 200K to Obama. He helped raise 200K through fundraising and donated 30.8K to committees supporting Obama. Whether he donated to Obama or not is not evidence of a “sick plan” to block Trump. This is a classic clickbait tactic and promotion of propaganda. Also, according to fact checkers, Subject Politics  has made false claims here and here. Lastly, Subject Politics often references very questionable sources in their articles. For example, in the article entitled “TRUMP WAS RIGHT! Obama’s Top Adviser Just Leaked His WORST Nightmare,” Subject Politics uses Rush Limbaugh as a source to support their story.

Questionable	Pro-Syrian State, Propaganda	Notes: Syria News is a news and opinion website all about Syria and the current conflict. Syria News has an extreme Pro-Syrian State bias and is highly critical of all opposition.  SN uses extreme loaded language to convey emotion against the opposition and often only presents one side of the story. We also could not find an “About” page nor any information on the authors that would give insight into their mission. We have purposely not rated this website for left or right bias because they consistently rail against both if they are opposed to the Syrian State. Another factor in placing this source in the questionable category is the use of self linking. Self linking is when you link to other pages on your own website rather than outside credible sources. Based on extreme state bias, poor sourcing, and lack of information on the website, we rate this source questionable. We are not stating the information is false, just that each article should be fact checked for accuracy. We also recognize there is a strong propaganda campaign against the Syrian State by the opposition and it can be difficult to determine where the truth lies. (5/24/2017)	syrianews.cc

According to a Guardian article entitled “The way of the Jackal”, Taki Theodoracopulos has racist views. Taki’s Magazine proclaims on its about page: “Our only ideology is to be against the junk culture foisted upon us by Hollywood and the mainstream media, and mirages of a new world order.” Taki’s Magazine’s former Executive Editor was Richard Spencer, who is an American white supremacist that coined the term Alternative Right. Gavin McInnes, who is a regular on Fox News also was a contributor until August 2017. His last column was entitled “So Long, Taki!” He has been described in media reports as a major figure within the alt-right movement. Gavin McInnes has also been featured in Hatewatch articles by the Southern Poverty Law Center, that can be found here and here. Taki’s Magazine features syndicated columns by such conservative figures as Pat Buchanan and Michelle Malkin, both of whom have mixed records with fact checkers. Taki’s Magazine published an article, “The Talk: Nonblack Version” written by John Derbyshire which makes questionable racial suggestions.

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Some Fake News	Notes: TheBreakingNews is a conservative news and opinion website. The site does not have an about page or any type of author information. TheBreakingNews uses excessive loaded emotional language that always favors the right such as this: “Jim Acosta attacks POTUS Trump’s uplifting speech to Texans – Trump supporters respond”. This headline portrays Jim Acosta (left) as doing something terrible to Trump, while at the same time praising Trump. This is a classic click bait propaganda headline. TheBreakingNews attempts to source their information, but often times it is to other Questionable extreme right websites such as Conservative 101. Lastly, TheBreakingNews has published a false claim via a fact checker. Overall, we rate TheBreakingNews as a Questionable source due to extreme right bias, promotion of propaganda and a poor track record with fact checkers. (M. Huitsing 9/1/2017)	thebreakingnews.today

Questionable	Right Libertarian, Propaganda	Notes: The Daily Bell (TDB) is a Pro-Libertarian news site. Ostensibly. The stories on the site are a mixed bag of misleading headlines, rambling writing, and thinly disguised ads. Long on hyperbole, but short on supporting links. TDB also seems to have a personal issue with Mark Zuckerberg, as three out of the ten stories on their main page were about him. Of the stories I read for the review, two stand out as examples of the issues with TDB noted above. The story under the headline “Slavery Is Freedom: Submit To The State And Be Free From Terrorism” the authors, simply credited as The Daily Bell staff, begin by briefly discussing the recent terrorist attack in London, then switch a long rant regarding TV licensing in the UK. They then switch to praising Czech President Milo Zeman for his extreme views on gun ownership. While any of these could have been used as a topic by themselves, putting all three in one story made it confusing and hard to follow. The story under the headline “Why The Money In Your Bank Account Is Not As Safe As You May Think” the authors, again credited only as The Daily Bell Staff, begin by making several unsubstantiated claims regarding government seizure of people’s bank accounts. The story then switches to a thinly disguised ad for offshore banking in general, and Sovereign Man in particular, a group that offers services for those wishing to move their money into offshore accounts. The lone standout compared to the other stories on TDB was a personal account by Michael Demas of his time working in Nepal through All Hands Volunteers after the 2015 earthquake. It was well written, thought provoking, uplifting, and poignant. This diamond among the quartz however, is the exception on TDB, not the norm. For the lack of focus in its stories, the advertising disguised as news, and the nearly nonexistent sourcing, TDB earns a Questionable rating. (D. Kelley 6/11/2017)	thedailybell.com

Questionable	Right, Propaganda	Notes: The Free Telegraph is an online publication with a privacy disclaimer at the bottom of the page that states “Paid for by Republican Governors Association, 1747 Penn. Ave. NW Suite 250, Washington DC. Not made with cooperation, consent, or consultation, or at request or suggestion of a candidate or her agent.” According to the Chicago Tribune, The Free Telegraph was launched by The Republican Governors Association to promote the virtues of GOP governors, while framing Democrats negatively. The Free Telegraph also did not disclose its connection to the The Republican Governors Association until The Associated Press inquired about it and claimed that critics had called it a propaganda site. In addition, according to the AP, former Ted Cruz campaign spokesman told the AP that “It’s propaganda for sure, even if they have objective standards and all the reporting is 100 percent accurate.” In review, both headlines and articles contain loaded words such as: “Michael Moore Makes A Fool of Himself (Again)”. All stories favor the right, in particular the work of Republican Governors. Although The Free Telegraph uses proper sources, information is spun in such a way as to promote propaganda for the Republican Governors and against Democrats. The Free Telegraph has also been flagged by the Web of Trust as being suspicious. Overall, we rate this publication as Right biased through story selection, wording and the fact that it is funded by the Republicans Governors Association. However, due to the initial secrecy of funding and promotion of propaganda we rate this source Questionable at this time. (M. Huitsing 9/22/2017)	freetelegraph.com

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Fake News	Two reviewers have thoroughly researched The Goldwater and have come to the same conclusion that this is a Questionable source. Our first review published on 8/23/2017 found two fake news stories and concluded that the website publishes stories with an extreme right wing bias that uses loaded language in particular against illegal immigrants. On 12/22/2017, The Goldwater wrote a negative article about Media Bias Fact Check due to our first review. The Goldwater also deceptively pasted their negative article about us over the two fake news examples provided in our first review. So, instead of the reader seeing the evidence we provided, they now are led to a negative article. This type of deception and link manipulation would automatically place a source on the Questionable list. A second review was completed on 12/26/2017. This review was done as a means to make sure our first review was accurate and fair in its assessment. Our second reviewer also concluded this is a questionable source based on having connections to the highly controversial 8Chan website, the use of poor sourcing and loaded language that treats minorities differently than whites. I have never reviewed this website, but within 2 minutes I located a fake news story: Japanese Porn Star Drowns In Semen While Filming Bukkake Scene. This fake/satire story originated in the now defunct Sunday Register, which was a known satirical website. The Goldwater did not label this article as satire, so one must assume it was passed off as real news. Overall, The Goldwater is a Questionable Source as confirmed by three different reviewers. Update: On 12/22/2017, The Goldwater wrote a negative article about Media Bias Fact Check and other credible fact checkers such as Politifact and Snopes. In an attempt to be deceptive, The Goldwater pasted this negative story into the hyperlinks we provided above to prove their Questionable rating. For example, these old links from above lead to their story about us.	thegoldwater.com

For example, The Political Tribune sourced an USA Today story about how congress may pass a bill to eliminate past Presidents pensions if they earn more than $400K per year. This obviously would impact all living Presidents, however the headline reads: Congress Wants To CANCEL Barack Obama’s Pension! Here Is Why. This is very misleading as the story has nothing to do with directly taking away Obama’s pension.

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Hate Group	Notes: According to The Religion of Peace about page they are “a pluralistic, non-partisan site concerned with Islam’s political and religious teachings according to its own texts. The purpose is to counter whitewashing and explain the threat that Islam truly poses to human dignity and freedom, as well as the violence and dysfunction that ensues as a direct consequence of this religion’s supremacist ideology.” In reality, this is a website that promotes anti-Muslim propaganda through only posting negative information about Islam, such as crimes that may not be related to ones religion such as this where they link to a Mixed factual source. In general, this source links to other media that has a right wing bias or is otherwise questionable by our methodology. The Religion of Peace also sources Robert Spencer in articles, who is on the Southern Poverty Law Center’s hate list. Overall, we rate The Religion of Peace as Questionable for having an extreme right wing bias, promotion of conspiracy/propaganda and hate group tendencies. (D.

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Hate Group	Notes: The Remnant is a Traditionalist Catholic newspaper published twice a month in the United States. Although its editors are not affiliated with any particular institute or traditionalist group, the paper is sympathetic to Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and the Society of St. Pius X. Founded in 1968, it is the oldest Traditionalist Catholic newspaper in the United States. The Remnant is considered an active “Radical Traditionalist Catholic” hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. According to the SPLC the Remnant is intolerant toward Jews through Holocaust denial and the claim that when the Anti-Christ arrives he will be a Jew. The Remnant also holds anti-LGBTQ views. Further, they endorse the New World Order conspiracy theory, however they believe the New World Order is run by Zionists.  The editors of The Remnant reject the claim that they are a hate group. In review, The Remnant has an extreme right wing bias in story selection that always favors the right. They strongly endorse Donald Trump and his policies. The Remnant uses loaded words in headlines/articles and typically doesn’t use hyperlink sourcing. Further, The Remnant does not support the consensus of science regarding climate change and even goes so far as to call it a hoax. Overall, we rate The Remnant Questionable based on extreme right bias, promotion of propaganda and conspiracy theories and others labeling them a hate group. (D.

Others include, claiming former President Obama is a Muslim and that the Sandy Hook Elementary Massacre was a government plot to take away guns. Further, the Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled Bradlee Dean an anti-LGBT hate monger.

While we can’t say this source is fake news, it is very close as most stories are simply propaganda. It is probably best to visit the site to see how extreme it is, but here is an example: “Barack Obama gets Devastating News from Judicial Watch,”  In this article they source Breitbart (Extreme Right), Truth Monitor (Questionable Source-Extreme Right) and finally Judicial Watch (Right with a poor fact checking record).

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Hate Group	Notes: Launched in 2013, The Unz Review is a political analysis website that defines itself as an ‘alternative’ to the ‘mainstream media.’ According to Ron Unz, who is the Editor-in-Chief and the owner of the site their mission is: “I would always prefer reading something disturbing than something dull.” The Unz Review has a long list of columnist and bloggers, although we couldn’t go through all of the list, some known names are Pat Buchanan, Steve Sailer, Ilana Mercer, and Ron Paul. Steve Sailer has been criticized as both a racist and Islamophobe. He is also listed as a promoter of hate by utilizing primitive stereotypes to describe people of color. Ilana Mercer is also listed as a promoter of hate toward Muslims, according the Southern Poverty Law Center. Further, Ron Unz has donated money to known hate groups and anti-Semite organizations. In review, The Unz Review publishes articles with loaded words such as “Trump’s Strategy Working—He’s Maneuvered Democrats, RINOS, Into Favoring Foreigners Over Americans.“ On this particular article they utilize questionable sources such as vdare.com, which is classified as an extremist White Nationalist group. They also use a different approach in which they utilize minimally loaded emotional language in their headlines such as “’Shithole Countries’: What Makes a Country? the Place or the People?” However, in the body of the article one can find plenty of racism and hate under the disguise of a philosophical discussion. Further, they also utilize factually mixed sources such as Mises Institute  and occasionally credible sources such as Consortium News and Politico, however they use them only to illustrate their far right views via questionable sources. Overall, we rate The Unz Review a Questionable Source due extreme right wing bias, promotion of propaganda and hate as well as utilizing poor sources. (M. Huitsing 2/12/2018)	unz.com

All stories are slanted positively toward the right and negatively to the left. The Washington Standard also promotes conspiracy theories such as the Clinton’s murdering people for political gain. Interestingly, The Washington Standard uses a deceptive technique to entice clicking for financial gain. Within articles such as the one above they place hyperlinks that one would expect to be the source of information they are referencing, but instead it takes you to another page on their website that asks you to follow their Facebook and Twitter accounts. There is no other information. Each time a person clicks those links they are collecting advertising revenue and offering zero supporting information. Here is an example: “In the previous campaign season, we saw a trail of bodies linked to Hillary Clinton, including murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich, who is believed to be the leaker of tens of thousands of Democratic National Committee emails.” When you click on those links there isn’t any information at all.

They’re Calling For Obama’s IMMEDIATE Arrest – He Was Just BUSTED Overnight!”  For this particular article they utilize questionable sources such as Conservative Daily Post, which has a poor track record with fact checkers. Further, Obama was not busted overnight and hence this is a fake propaganda story that anyone can Google for accurate information. Essentially, the headline is misleading and does not match the story. A search of this website via DbRegistry shows that it is owned by Jose Alvarez from Caracas, Venezuela, who is also affiliated with 36 other websites. Further, this website is nearly impossible to navigate with pop-ups, pop-unders and redirect advertising. This is not a credible source.

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Fake News	Notes: Truth in Media is a website owned and operated by Benjamin Swann who is an American television news anchor and journalist. He has worked in New Mexico, Texas, Ohio, Washington, D.C., and Georgia. While at Fox affiliate WXIX-TV in Cincinnati, Ohio, he began producing a fact-checking series entitled “Reality Check”, which has garnered media attention for presenting conspiracy theories. According their about page: “Truth In Media’s content echoes the honest, unabashed and groundbreaking reporting that millions of people have appreciated from Ben for many years. Our mission is to continue our role in upholding integrity and impartiality in the Fourth Estate with an exceptional lineup that shares an ambition to preserve candor in the media.” In review, Truth in Media attempts to investigate stories that the mainstream media won’t cover. One of the reasons why the mainstream media won’t cover these topics is because they are not true or have been debunked. For example, Ben Swann has promoted the Pizzagate conspiracy theory as well as those related to the Sandy Hook Elementary Massacre. Swann has expressed skepticism of the scientific consensus that vaccines do not cause autism. Further, almost all of Truth in Media’s stories favor the right and discredit the left. Truth in Media/Ben Swann also has a poor track record with fact checkers. Overall, we rate Truth in Media a Questionable source based on overt right wing bias, promotion of conspiracies and a poor track record with fact checkers. (7/19/2016) Updated (D.

Sources listed in the Questionable Categorymaybe very untrustworthy and should be fact checked on a per article basis. Please note sources on this listare notconsideredfake newsunless specifically written in the notes section for that source.See all Questionable sources.	Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Some Fake News	Notes: The Truth Monitor is an extreme Alt-right website that promotes propaganda. Examples: Article: JUST IN: HUNDREDS SHOT, MORE INJURED…The fact is solid – there is indeed 403 shootings by Feb 14th in Chicago.  The link to Breitbart then links to the Chicago Tribune – (should have just linked to the source and not link to a link).   False statement from article: “When the shootings continued to increase, Trump sent in more ATF agents at the beginning of February in an effort to reduce the gun crime epidemic that has overtaken the city.” – this is false.  They link to nothing however this news article the ATF denies that any new agents were sent or even Trump asking them too.    Lastly on this article it makes a statement which is not fact or lie but pure opinion.  It’s purely a biased statement often heard form the right: “Since Chicago has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, what’s happening there serves as proof that gun control laws will NOT lower crime.” Judge Makes HORRIFYING Announcement About Impeaching Trump  – Clickbait emotional headline and reports accurately, then adds one sentence that shows extreme bias – “He claimed Trump knows nothing about “[b]asic American values,” the Constitution, or separation of powers. However, what Painter did not disclose was a single piece of evidence as to WHY Trump should be impeached.

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda	Notes: Truth Uncensored is a news and opinion website with an extreme right wing bias in reporting. Every article either favors the right or is negative toward the left. There is extensive use of loaded emotional words, especially when describing news that involves liberals. Truth Uncensored also promotes propaganda, such as when they claim: President Trump Cuts More US Debt for a Longer Period of Time THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. While it may be true that the debt has been cut since Trump took office, the actual budget and spending is from President Obama’s fiscal year 2017 budget, which runs until September 30, 2017. Any changes in debt will not be associated with Donald Trump. This is a classic example of propaganda, where a fact is used to mislead people. In this same article they also use questionable sources such as The Gateway Pundit and BB4SP. Truth Uncensored also has a misleading claim via Snopes. Overall, we rate Truth Uncensored as a Questionable Source based on promotion of extreme right wing propaganda and the use of poor sources who have failed many fact checks. (D.

There is strong use of loaded emotional language in their headlines and articles such as “Ted Cruz: Americans Have No Right To Masturbate.” Underground Journalist sometimes utilizes credible sources such as jstor.org, LA Times and Politifact, however they also use factually mixed sources and sometimes they don’t source at all.

The blog articles are written well and do not use loaded words, however it is difficult to ascertain what sources they are using to draw their conclusions.

The content of headlines and articles use loaded words and most times quote sources that are right biased or questionable such as the Gateway Pundit. For example, the headline on the front page of the website says “CLIMATE CHANGE HOAX”, however when you click on it the headline changes to PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT FALLING APART AS COUNTRIES CAN’T KEEP PLEDGE, OBAMA, GORE, LAPDOG MEDIA ALL SILENT. This is misleading because in the article they do not mention anything about a hoax. This is a classic clickbait tactic. In another case they claim that in Hillary Clinton’s emails she detailed 5 different way to murder Chris Stevens in Benghazi. This is 100% false as the emails simply state where Chris Stevens is traveling to and his agenda. This is a conspiracy theory.

Questionable	Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Some Fake News	Notes: USA Viral News Today (UVNT) is a news and opinion website with an extreme right wing bias in reporting. All stories favor the right and are anti-left. Headlines and article content are littered with loaded emotional words that favor the right. USA Viral News Today also utilizes poor sources such as Sean Hannity, who has a poor track record with fact checkers. For Example, UVNT published a video that Sean Hannity released claiming that President Obama praised Islam: Sean Hannity releases 4 minute video of Obama praising Islam. This is an old conspiracy that has been debunked many times during Obama’s Presidency. Overall, UVNT is a questionable source based on extreme right wing bias, poor sourcing, promotion of propaganda, conspiracies and fake news. (D. Van Zandt 9/7/2017)	usaviralnewstoday.com

Questionable	Christian	Notes: Vatican Radio (VR) is, as stated on the site: “The voice of the Pope and the Church in dialogue with the World.” As such, it exists to promote the Catholic faith to the world, and the majority of the stories on the site have a decidedly religious slant. That said, VR is not overly evangelical in its reporting. While the majority of the articles on VR focus on day to day matters concerning the Vatican, and the Pope, they do carry some non-religion world news as well. These non-religious articles are factual and presented, with a minimum of religious bias. In comparison to other religion based news sources VR is, on the whole, well written, informative, and well presented. Unfortunately, Media Bias / Fact Check judges news sources primarily on factual content and bias in reporting. Faith based reporting, by its nature, contains an inherent bias, and presents information that is not verifiable by standard fact checking methods. For this reason, VR is rated Questionable. (D.

Questionable	Conspiracy, Anti-Islam	Notes: WikiIslam was founded in 2006 by Ali Sina and Faith Freedom International. Essentially, WikiIslam is an anti-Islam wiki that purports to have 2893 articles/pages about Islam as of today. In review, most information on this wiki paints a negative picture of Islam. It also favors other non-Islamic religions over Islam. Another aspect of this Wiki that is Questionable is that anyone can edit the contents. Therefore, it may not be trustworthy for factual information. While there is some very factual and in-depth information about the Quran on this wiki, there is also many opinion pieces that are not based in fact, but rather conjecture. On the other hand, because WikiIslam can be edited by anyone there are also many pro-Islam refutations that may not be rooted in fact. Overall, it is not fair to call this a hate group and the SPLC and other organizations have not as of yet. It is fair to say that the information on this wiki needs to be fact checked against credible sources as there are many opinions presented that are based on very subjective texts and hence why we do not give a Right-Left bias rating and rate WikiIslam Questionable.

What political news BC carries is tech-centric as well, such as the article concerning Ajit Pai, President Trump&#8217;s pick to head the FCC. While the reporting on BC is solid there is, however, a slightly left bias in the overall tone. Much of that bias is inherent in the subject matter, but it doesn&#8217;t account for all of it. For this reason Back Channel is rated Left Center. (D. Kelley 3/14/2017)	backchannel.com

The articles I reviewed were either direct reprints or heavily sourced from Least Biased sources such asReutersandAssociated Press. Those articles that are not direct carry overs do contain a slight Left Bias, although the reporting is, again, well sourced and factual. Note: This review is only based on GN&#8217;s political reporting, and while this reviewer is no expert on Canadian politics, the articles I read on those subjects appeared to have a slight Left Bias as well.

Founded by Alison Weir, IAK&#8217;s goal is, as stated on the site: “The mission of If Americans Knew is to inform and educate the American public on issues of major significance that are unreported, underreported, or misreported in the American media.”IAK, in line with their stated goals, provides comprehensive information not only on the history of the conflict but also on daily affairs of the region. While there is a decidedly pro-Palestine slant to IAK, it appears to be  mostly inherent in the content itself, as the articles and information provided are factual, well sourced, and presented with a minimum of editorializing. Despite the pro-Palestinian slant, and the lack of reporting from Israel&#8217;s point of view, the factual content provided earns IAK a Left Center rating. (D. Kelley 3/29/2017)	ifamericaknew.org

Left-center	HIGH	National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) is a grassroots civil rights organization which was founded on February 12, 1909. In its early years theNAACPfocused on racial discrimination and violence against African Americans including the practice of lynching. At present, theNAACP’’s focus is “on disparities in economics, health care, education, voter empowerment and the criminal justice system while also continuing its role as legal advocate for civil rights issues.&#8221; The NAACP has had many historical milestones in its history, including the Anti-Lynching Bill and the Voting Rights Act.The NAACP is not without controversy as theThe Internal Revenue Servicehas also reviewed their tax-exempt status after Conservatives criticized the NAACP tax exempt status and its assertion of being apolitical. TheWashington Postreported that “the IRS said the group, the nation&#8217;s oldest and largest civil rights organization, &#8220;continued to qualify&#8221; as tax-exempt.”In review, the website presents news and information with minimal loaded words and they always source to credible media. The issues that the NAACP champion are those that are affiliated with the political left. Overall, we rate the NAACP as Left-Center Biased based on the political affiliation of the issues they support and highly factual based on proper sourcing. (M. Huitsing 8/29/2017)	naacp.org

Left-center	HIGH	National Monitor (NM) is an online news and opinion site managed by Paul Kilmartin. NM&#8217;s goal, as stated in their tagline, is to present “Opinions and analysis from all angles”. In this they are largely successful, offering articles from the far left to the far right, and everything in between.  The articles from the staff writers on NM are consistently well written, factual, and well sourced. They also offer some refreshingly different views on subjects.For example, in the article “Free College Tuition? Meh.” author Michael Patrick Lewis, a self proclaimed liberal, offers an interesting and thought provoking view / mild rebuttal of the free College for everyone idea popular among liberals and progressives.All of the above stated, however, many of the articles on NM exhibit a distinct Left Bias, as does the overall editorial tone of NM.  Normally that would earn a site a Left Bias rating without question. NM&#8217;s willingness, however, to present such a wide range of content coupled with the lack of hyperbole and sensationalism present on many Left Bias sites earns them, with caution, a Left Center rating.

Left	MIXED	Mean Left Hook is an unashamedly left bias site heavily loaded the most sensationalistic and confrontational rhetoric of the left. The articles, if they can honestly be called articles in the usual sense, are little more than the type of rants against the right you would find on a Facebook page. Mean Left Hook does in fact have a FB page which is primarily links to their articles sprinkled with pro left cartoons and memes.While the articles in Mean Left Hook are somewhat factual they, like clickbait sites on both sides, present their facts in the most biased way possible. For example, in their report on Tennessee bill HB 1406, which seeks to repeal a state statute which deems an artificially inseminated child born to a woman and her spouse to be their legitimate child, regardless of actual biological relationship to the parents.  While the difference between being the parents legitimate child and the child being illegitimate is slight, and may be debatable depending on Tennessee&#8217;s laws, keying on that aspect of the bill is misleading at best. Nor does the article address the deeper and much more complex issues regarding the bill, which appears to be a step towards denying parents rights to same sex couples. See link toSnopes. Mean Left Hook, again like many clickbait sites on both sides, narrowly escapes being labeled fake news only because their articles contain at least a tiny grain of truth.Lastly, a word of caution regarding some of their links. I clicked on a link purportedly about a scandal with Rachel Maddow and MSNBC. It looked like a legitimate link, but instead went to a poorly written ad for a dietary aid that Ms. Maddow supposedly uses. (D. Kelley 2/21/2017)	meanlefthook.com

The blogs on the site were  a mixed bag, running the gamut from left bias political commentary, to UFO&#8217;s, to spirituality. Other than the blog commentary, Nap-Sack is a-political as it encourages visitors to speak their mind regardless of their political and social views.

Nap-Sack, as it is a social media site and doesn&#8217;t pretend to be anything else, does not easily fit in any of the usual MBFC categories.

Least-biased	HIGH	Amnesty International(AI) is a non-governmental organization focused on human rights that claims to have over 7 million members and supporters around the world. The stated objective of the organization is &#8220;to conduct research and generate action to prevent and end grave abuses of human rights, and to demand justice for those whose rights have been violated.&#8221; Thecore principle of Amnesty Internationalis a focus on prisoners of conscience, those persons imprisoned or prevented from expressing any opinion other than violence. Along with this commitment to opposing repression of freedom of expression, Amnesty International&#8217;s founding principles included non-intervention on political questions, a robust commitment to gathering facts about the various cases and promoting human rights.Governments and their supporters have criticized Amnesty&#8217;s criticism of their policies, including those of Australia, Czech Republic,China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Iran, Israel, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Russia and the United States,for what they assert is one-sided reporting or a failure to treat threats to security as a mitigating factor. The actions of these governments — and of other governments critical of Amnesty International — have been the subject of human rights concerns voiced by Amnesty.Amnesty International is not without controversy, however from a news reporting standpoint, they are factual and credible. They report with minimal bias, however the issues that they champion are typically those supported by the political left. Based on evidence based reporting we still rate Amnesty on the left side of least biased by our criteria. (D. Van Zandt 7/17/2017)	amnesty.org

Least-biased	HIGH	Eagle Tribune is an online newspaper serving Andover, MA, and the surrounding areas. Its primary focus is on local news and events. They appear to have little to do with national issues, as there was only one article relating to national news on the site. The story, “Trump Pulls Back In His War With The Press”, covers the President&#8217;s recent address to Congress, and the lack of attacks on the press during his speech. It is fairly and accurately reported, containing remarks from both Republicans and Democrats regarding the lack of attacks. While the article has a very slight right bias, it is by a Washington DC reporter, Kery Murakari. a stringer for Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc. (CNHI). As such, it does not necessarily reflect the editorial stance of the Eagle Tribune itself. Nor does the tone of one article constitute a valid sampling for assigning a bias to a news source. With that in mind, I rated the Eagle Tribune Least Biased. (D. Kelley 3/5/2017)	eagletribune.com
